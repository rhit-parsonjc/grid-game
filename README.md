# Grid Game

This is a console application that runs a grid game with the following rules:

1. Your player starts at the top left corner. You can move to the right (East) or down (South). Your goal is to reach the bottom-right corner.

2. At each spot, you have to encounter an enemy.
- If your level is higher than the enemy's, your level will be incremented by the enemy's level.
- If your level is lower than the enemy's, you will be defeated and will restart at the top-left corner.

3. The level of any enemy is not visible until you encounter the enemy.
